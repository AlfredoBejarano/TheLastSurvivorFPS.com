			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				In this page you can find some special details about my craft, such as which software I use or what instruments do I play.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Which software do I use?</h3>
				<p>
					For editing audio I use Cockos REAPER, I find REAPER quite powerful yet simple to use and is quite cheap too.
				</p>
				<p>
					For editing video I use DaVinci Resolve. Which is a free alternative to more expensive software such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas. For just cutting and pasting video is more than enough for me.
				</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>How do I get my guitar tone?</h3>
				<p>
					<p>
						I used to use Ignite Amps Emissary and Rosen Digital MESA oversized Cabinet IR impulses for Guitar and TSE BOD with Focusrite compressor and EQ plugins for Bass.
											</p>
											<p>
						Recently I acquired Line6 Pod Farm and created my guitar patches based on the Orange Crush 120 Head which is what gets the nearest sounding to my Orange Micro Dark with a Celestion V30 speaker.
					</p>
					<p>
						I used the Micro Dark and the V30 in the Zelda's Lullaby cover. I'll like to use it more but I got a noise complaint from my neighbours so I can't use it anymore for recording.
					</p>
					<p>
						For drums, I used MT Power Drum Kit which is a free and quite powerful alternative to EZDrummer2.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I use EZDrummer2 which I had no particular reason to replace MT Power DrumKit. I grabbed it for dirt cheap in a Toontrack sale.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had no real particular reason to replace Ignite Amps and MT Power DrumKit plugins with PodFarm and EZDrummer2. I did it more from the nostalgia that nothing else really as those plugins were used by VGM legends such as CSGuitar89 or ArtificialFear.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're in a budget or don't want to invest in plugins, MT Power DrumKit and Ignite Amps offerings are more than enough. The Gerudo Desert song was recorded using those.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>What are my musical roots / influences?</h3>
					<p>
						My dad is metalhead himself for quite a while now, it's from him that I acquired liking for both guitar and metal music.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oddly enough, I enjoy more playing bass and listening to House music than metal.
					</p>
					<p>
						My metal influences are short as I grew listening only to three metal bands: Killswitch Engage, Bullet For My Valentine and Lamb of God. Recently I opened my repertory a little bit listening to Ola Englund and Kamelot.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other bands I used to listen while growing up were: Alient Ant Farm, Paramore, Lost Prophets, Linking Park and 30 Seconds to Mars.
					</p>
					<p>
						I always felt that my metal compositions were a little bit stale and I got what I call a "metal fatigue" that lasted for 5 years. In that time I listened to electronic music, mostly from the Monstercat label.
					</p>
					<p>
						I got to appreciate more genres and I grew a liking to other artists as well such as EDEN project, Vicetone, Nitro Fun, Cozi Zuehlsdorff, Laura Brehm, Post Malone, Residente and Bad Bunny just to name a few. Most of the arrangements that I add to my music, like the bass drop in The Minish Cap Boss Battle song for example, came from listening to electronic music.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my "metal fatigue" years I stopped playing guitar entirely and stopped listening to metal and consuming metal content in sites like YouTube. The only metal channel I followed was SpectreMediaGroup. Im a big fan of Glenn Fricker's work.
					</p>								
					<p>
						<h3>Which gear do I use?</h3>
						<p>
							My setup is quite simple as I don't think I could use something more professional as I do this as a hobby.
						</p>
						<p>
							I use a Focusrite Scarlett Solo as my Interface. It is hooked via USB to my PC and via RCA cables to my M-Audio AV 30 monitors.
						</p>
						<p>
							I plug the guitar to the second input in the Scarlett interface. I also use an Audio-Technica AT2020 microphone connected to the first input of the interface.
						</p>
						<h3>Guitars</h3>					
						<p>
							<h4>Jackson Dinky JS22-7 DKA TH Custom</h4>
							<p>
								I've bought this guitar recently as my father invited me to play with him live with one of his bands.
								My dad wanted to start playing in Drop tunning but the idea of carrying two guitars was quite daunting.
								The idea of a 7 strings came from Ola Englund visiting my city back in 2014 as he explained he plays 7 strings because he can tune the guitar in 7 strings Drop A tunning and play drop chords and riffs but also from the 6th string upwards, the tunning is E standard, so classic metal songs (or the one my father composed in this case) can be played without the need of carrying two guitars.
							</p>
							<p>
								The "custom" part of this guitar comes from a trip I made to Vancouver. I acquired a set of EMG 56/66 pickups for 7 string guitars, which are quite rare items in my region. These pickups were soap bars and wouldn't fit the F-type spaces. My best friend made the cuts to fit the pickups and also designed and 3D printed some pickup frames, the guitar now sounds fantastic.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is currently tunned to 7 Strings Drop A tunning (A-E-A-D-G-B-E)
							</p>
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Schecter Damien Elite 6 CBR</h4>
							<p>
								I've had this guitar for a long time now. It was a gift from a girlfriend way back in 2014. I tunned this guitar to Drop C Tunning. For a couple of years, it was tunned to Drop D tunning. I rarely use this guitar now as I got a liking to 7 string guitars recently.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is currently tunned to Drop C tunning (C-G-C-F-A-D).
							</p>
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Ibanez Talman TCY10E TBS</h4>
							<p>
								This was the first guitar I bought saving money. I was a student at the time so this was quite the effort to me. This acoustic guitar plays fantastic and has accompanied me for 6 years now and still feels and plays like it is new. It is also quite versatile as it has been tunned in both Drop C and Standard E tunning for several years.
							</p>
							<p>
							It is currently tunned to Standard E tunning (E-A-D-G-B-E).
							</p>
						</p>
						<h3>Basses</h3>
						<p>
							<h4>Ibanez GSR206B WNF</h4>
							<p>
								I got curious about the Bossa Nova genre, which I thought a 6 string bass would be a nice acquisition.
							</p>
							<p>
								This bass is basically the 6 string version of the GSR200FM AMB. It's equally an active bass and it sounds amazing, even though it's a GIO bass. Talking about bass guitars, you can't go wrong with Ibanez.
							</p>
							<p>
								I started using it in the Rest (Resident Evil 0 save theme) song.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is tunned to 6 String Bass drop A Tunning (A-E-A-D-G-C)
							</p>
						</p>				
						<p>
							<h4>Ibanez GSR200FM AMB</h4>
							<p>
								When I got back to play guitar I lacked a bass, the relative that I gifted the SR305 came to repay the favour and let me borrow this bass. I was surprised how versatile this bass is. I've been using it since Zelda's lullaby cover. I returned it as I got curious to play bossa nova music and I was in the hunt for a 6 string bass.
							</p>					
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Ibanez SR300 PW</h4>
							<p>
								I purchased this bass a little while after I got the Schecter guitar. This bass was also tunned to Drop C. In my "metal fatigue" years I also stopped playing guitar completely. As this bass was collecting dust, I gave it as a gift to a relative.
