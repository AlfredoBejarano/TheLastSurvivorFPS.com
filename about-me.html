				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>In this page, you can read more about me as a musician and about the stuff I use to make my videos.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="musical-influences">
				<h3>What are my musical roots / influences ?</h3>
				<p>
					My dad is a metalhead himself since he was 16. It's from him that I acquired liking for both guitar and metal music.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oddly enough, I enjoy more playing bass and listening to House music than metal.
				</p>
				<p>
					My metal influences are short as I grew listening only to three metal bands: Killswitch Engage, Bullet For My Valentine and Lamb of God. Recently I opened my repertory a little bit listening to Ola Englund and Kamelot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other bands I used to listen while growing up were: Alien Ant Farm, Paramore, Lost Prophets, Linking Park and 30 Seconds to Mars.
				</p>
				<p>
					I always felt that my metal compositions were a little bit stale and I got what I call a "metal fatigue" that lasted for 5 years. At that time I listened to electronic music, mostly from the Monstercat label.
				</p>
				<p>
					I got to appreciate more genres and I grew a liking to other artists as well such as EDEN project, Vicetone, Nitro Fun, Cozi Zuehlsdorff, Laura Brehm, Post Malone, Residente and Bad Bunny just to name a few. Most of the arrangements that I add to my music, like the bass drop in The Minish Cap Boss Battle song, for example, came from listening to electronic music.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my "metal fatigue" years I stopped playing guitar entirely, stopped listening to metal and consuming metal content in sites like YouTube. The only metal channel I followed was SpectreMediaGroup. I'm a big fan of Glenn Fricker's work.
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div id="software">
				<h3>What software do I use?</h3>
				<p>
					For editing audio I use Cockos REAPER, REAPER is a powerful DAW and yet simple to use, and the best part is that it's only $69 bucks.
				</p>
				<p>
					For editing video I use Premiere Pro, It's more than enough of what I do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sadly, is not as cheap as REAPER.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="gear">
				<h3>Which studio gear do I use?</h3>
				<p>
					At the beggining, I used a Focusrite Scarlett Solo 1st gen plugged into a set of M-audio AV30 studio monitors. The connection output from the interface to the monitors was via RCA cables and the input to the PC was via an USB-B to USB-A cable.
				</p>
				<p>
					I recently updagred the Scarlett Solo to a Scarlett 2i2 3rd gen and the M-audio monitors to a set of KRK systems Rokit 7 G4 Studio monitors. The connection with the upgraded gear is from the interface to the monitors via 6,35mm TRS cables and from the interface to the PC via USB-C to USB-A cable.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also own an Audio-Technica AT-2020 condenser microphone that I use sometimes to record acoustic guitar or an amplifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					To record my videos I use my phone's camera, which is a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G.
				</p>
				<p>
					My PC is a Ryzen 5 3600X powered PC. It has 40 GB of RAM memory with 120 GB + 2TB of SSD and hard drive storage and a RX590 graphics card. It runs Windows 10.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="guitar-tone">
				<h3>How to I get my guitar tone?</h3>
				<p>
					I plug my guitar to the interface and from the interface, I record the clean guitar signal straight into REAPER.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beggining, I used Line6 PodFarm 2 with Rosen Digital MESA oversized impulses.
				</p>
				<p>
					I felt that the PodFarm tones sounded a little bit old and I moved to the Ignite Emissary plug-in, it is a free and amazing guitar amplifier simulator.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, I moved the to NaLex Ninja, another free VST plugin. As It's voicing is more to my liking than one the Emissary has. For both simulators I still use the Rosen Digital MESA oversized impulses.
				</p>
				<p>
					After all the signal chain I use an instance of ReaXComp. A multi-band compressor that helps me keep the bass section of the guitar under control.

				<h3>Guitars</h3>
				<h4>Jackson Dinky JS22-7 DKA TH Custom</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/js227.png" />
				<p>
					I've bought this guitar recently as my father invited me to play with him live with one of his bands. My dad wanted to start playing in Drop tunning but the idea of carrying two guitars was quite daunting. The idea of a 7 strings came from Ola Englund visiting my city back in 2014 as he explained he plays 7 strings because he can tune the guitar in 7 strings Drop A tunning and play drop chords and riffs but also from the 6th string upwards, the tunning is E standard, so the ones my father composed in E standard can be played without the need of carrying two guitars.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "custom" part of this guitar is that I installed a set of EMG 56/66 pickups and a pair of custom designed 3D printed pickup frames.
				</p>
				<h4>Schecter Damien Elite 6 CBR</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/damienelite6.png" />
				<p>
					I've had this guitar since 2014. I tunned this guitar to Drop C Tunning and for a couple of years, it was tunned to Drop D tuning.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was collecting dust and I don't have an interest in keep playing to Drop C tunning, so I returned it to Standard E to become the lead guitar in my videos.
				</p>
				<h4>Ibanez Talman TCY10E TBS</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/tcy10e.png" />
				<p>
					This was the first guitar I bought saving money, I was a student at the time so this was quite the effort to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					This acoustic guitar plays fantastic and has accompanied me for 6 years now and still feels and plays like it is new.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also quite versatile as it has been tunned in both Drop C and Standard E tunning for several years.
				</p>
				<h4>Ibanez GRG170DX CA</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/grg170dx.png" />
				<p>
					There's nothing I can say about this guitar. My dad traded an old netbook laptop for this guitar and even though it plays nice, there isn't anything special about it. It's a cheap guitar that could be a very good first guitar for someone starting playing guitar but compared to my other guitars, is not that impressive.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used it in the intro of the Ballad of the Windish cover as a little easter egg to CSGuitar89's video as he used his Bullet Strat, which is the only time I used it in a video.
				</p>

				<h3>Bass Guitars</h3>
				<h4>Ibanez GSR206B WNF</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/gsr206b.png" />
				<p>
					I got curious about the Bossa Nova genre, which I thought a 6 string bass would be a nice acquisition. This bass is the 6 string version of the GSR200FM AMB.
				</p>
				<h4>Ibanez GSR200FM AMB</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/gsr200fm.png" />
				<p>
					When I got back to play guitar I lacked a bass, the relative that I gifted the SR305 came to repay the favour and let me borrow this bass. I was surprised how versatile this bass is. I've been using it since Zelda's lullaby cover. I returned it as I got curious to play bossa nova music and I was in the hunt for a 6 string bass.
				</p>
				<h4>Ibanez SR300 PW</h4>
				<img class="instrument" src="./assets/images/sr300.png" />
				<p>
					I purchased this bass a little while after I got the Schecter guitar. This bass was also tunned to Drop C. In my "metal fatigue" years this instrument was just collecting dust in my wall so I gave it as a gift to a relative.

				<h3>Picks</h3>
				<p>
					For picks, I use Dunlop Jazz III 1.14mm picks for electric guitar and bass.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't use a particular material though I like the UltexÂ® variants more.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ones I use at a given time are what delivers the fastest from amazon when my current picks wear out.
